Notes to my future self.

# Why?

Years back I rolled out some 1Wire devices to meter our electrical consumption. This guided changes to our lighting that drastically reduced our electiricity bill. It also lead to various other home automation projects: a pool topper upper, a gate pin pad, notifications when sumps flooded etc. 

But, over time, power supplies failed, wires corroded, and technology moved forward. Its time to add a few cameras, and, it seems we should embrace Home Assistant.

# Goals

1. Keep the pool topped up
2. Track and report on network latency
3. Meter resources: in particular, electricity and water
4. Automate the locks
5. Manage footage from the cameras, and reconcile this to events generated by the alarm system.
