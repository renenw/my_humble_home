Notes to my future self. And to anyone following my tracks.

# Why?

Years back I rolled out some 1Wire devices to meter our electrical consumption. This guided changes to our lighting that drastically reduced our electiricity bill. It also lead to various other home automation projects: a pool topper-upper, a gate pin pad, notifications when sumps flooded, weather based garden irrigation etc. 

But, over time, power supplies failed, wires corroded, and technology moved forward. Its time to add a few cameras, and, it seems we should embrace Home Assistant.

# Goals

1. Keep the pool topped up
2. Track and report on network latency
3. Meter resources: in particular, electricity and water
4. Automate the locks
5. Manage footage from the cameras, and reconcile this to events generated by the alarm system.

# Getting Going

I bought a little Beelink computer with 2.5GB os SSD, and 16GB of RAM. I installed Ubuntu 22.10 onto it.

# Internet Monitoring: Latency

As a place to start, I want to track the performance of my network. Initially, this means pinging a rande of servers and gateways to guage reachability and latency. Speed will come later.

## Choices

CollectD versus Telegraf versus [home grown](https://github.com/renenw/ping): Both Telegraf and CollectD include ping modules - so this feels like a better approach than rolling my own. Also, Influx exists in the same ecosystem as Grafana and Home Assistant. So the Telegraf-Influx pair seem lke a natural choice.
